Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
===
This project contains all code I wrote for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree of Udacity. One directory for one project of the Nanodegree. 

- P1-MTW: Movie Trailer Website
    + There are three programs:
    + media.py: Has a class for Movie
    + entertainment_center.py: Create movies and generate the website
    + fresh_tomatoes.py: Provide functions to generate a website
    + Usage: run entertainment_center.py, it will generate a html file, then open it. You can add your own movie into the file and re-run the program to generate a new html file.
